# mnisthandgesture
Developing an OpenCV based project for hand gesture recognition from camera and convert it into text in real time using M.L. based algorithms. 


The EMNIST version in theory should be able to detect digits as well as alphabets. I'll link the weight files later, since I am not able to upload it directly because it's bigger than 25 MB
